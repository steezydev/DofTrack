> DofTrack is a **REAL** user-friendly task tracker. With no penalties or punishments. No matter what user will only get positive emotions.

# About
The key feature of DofTrack is itâ€™s gentleness. Unlike other task tracking applications DofTrack doesnâ€™t get on your nerves with never-ending *<span style="color: red">red deadlines</span>*. On the contrary, it focuses on rewarding you for completed tasks. 

## Entities
The main entities of DofTrack are
 - Dream
 - Goal
 - Task & Activity

### Dream
**Dream** is the top entity which represents a huge goal *ex.: Become a Front-end developer* (basically the name speaks for itself). **Dream** consists of several **goals** which on complete would fulfill your dream.

### Goal
**Goal** is smaller than a **dream** and represents a specific aim to be accomplished *ex.: Learn javascript*. Goals consist of **tasks** and **activities**.

### Tasks
**Task** is just a task ðŸ˜… You have a title, description, deadline and difficulty level (will be explained later) 

### Activity
**Activity** is a timer which refers to some kind of a task you should do for some period of time *ex.: Read "You donâ€™t know JS"*. When the timer reaches 0, you are able to continue tracking time for that **activity** but the timer goes up infinitely now but you still get rewarded for that.


## Rewarding system
For every **task** or **activity** finished the user gets rewarded with **gems**. The amount of **gems** user gets scales with difficulty (for **activities** - with time spent). 

When creating a **goal** user sets an amount of **gems** he has too reach completing the tasks to accomplish the **goal**.
